# Differences between Document and Window Objects #   
 The Document and Window objects are fundamental components of the Document Object Model (DOM), representing the structure and content of a web page.
## Document Object ##   
* The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser.   
* It provides methods and properties to interact with the content of the document, such as accessing and manipulating elements, modifying styles, or handling events within the document.   
* It represents the HTML content of the page, including elements like <body>, <head>, and other HTML tags.
## Window Object ##   
* The window object represents the browser window or tab.   
* It provides methods and properties for controlling the browser, navigating to URLs, setting timeouts/intervals, handling cookies, and managing the history.
